Move with wasd, move camera with arrows

So I got the Cel Shading Working, notice the 2 levels of color, along with the
outlining of the landscape. It was difficult allowing the incorporation of colors,
but that has been added. The outline works on all 3d objects, need to fix 2d objects.

so now I need to add the Textures to the objects. I need to design a few more
objects, fix the lighting a outlining on the tree, and fix the lighting of a few objects

The final step will just be modifying the sizes of everything, adding animation,
and

run make and ./CelShading
